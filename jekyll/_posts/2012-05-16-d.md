####Introduction: the Unix shell

Every language has its environment. Javascript has the browser, Java has the JVM, and ASP.net has Windows. The optimal environment for Ruby on Rails is Unix. You can run Unix shell commands on the Linux or OS X terminal, or on Windows using Cygwin.

In this guide (and many other websites), shell commands are prefixed by a dollar sign in order to distinguish them from Ruby code, which may look similar. They aren't part of the command.

####Setup

The command for setting up your development database is:

    $ rake db:create

If you want to set up databases for other environments, you can do so using the environment variable RAILS_ENV:

    $ RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create

Or, you can set them all up at once:

    $ rake db:create:all

####Migrations

Migrations are a way to change the _schema_, or structure of your database. For example, the following command:

    $ rails g migration CreatePostsTable

...prints this output:

      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20120516155552_create_posts_table.rb

...and creates this migration file:

{% highlight ruby %}
    class CreatePostsTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

You can then write Rails code in this file that alters your database.

{% highlight ruby %}
    class CreatePostsTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :posts do |t|
          t.string :title
          t.text :body
        end
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

You can run this migration like this:

    $ rake db:migrate

Migrations can also be reverted.

    $ rake db:migrate:down VERSION=20120516155552

####Other commands

Here are some more useful database-related commands in Rails:

    $ rake db:seed
    $ rake db:test:clone_structure
    $ rake db:destroy
    $ rake db:reset
