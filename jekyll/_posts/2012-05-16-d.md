####Introducing the shell

Rails doesn't come with a database built-in, but instead offers an interface to your database via the Unix shell. You can run shell commands on the Linux or OS X terminal, or on Windows using Cygwin. In this guide (and many other websites), shell commands are prefixed by a dollar sign in order to distinguish them from Ruby code. The dollar sign is not part of the command.

####Setup

The command for setting up your development database is:

    $ rake db:create

If you want to set up databases for other environments, you can do so using the environment variable RAILS_ENV:

    $ RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create

Or, you can set them all up at once:

    $ rake db:create:all

####Migrations

Migrations are a way to change the _schema_, or structure of your database. For example, the following command:

    $ rails g migration CreatePostsTable

...prints this output:

      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20120516155552_create_posts_table.rb

...and creates this migration file:

{% highlight ruby %}
    class CreatePostsTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

You can then write Rails code in this file that alters your database.

{% highlight ruby %}
    class CreatePostsTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :posts do |t|
          t.string :title
          t.text :body
        end
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

You can run this migration like this:

    $ rake db:migrate

Migrations can also be reverted.

    $ rake db:migrate:down VERSION=20120516155552

####Other commands

Here are some more useful database-related commands in Rails:

    $ rake db:seed
    $ rake db:test:clone_structure
    $ rake db:destroy
    $ rake db:reset
