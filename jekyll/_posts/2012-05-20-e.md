####Preamble: ERb vs. Haml

Some Rubyists may be less than pleased to see ERb featured here rather than Haml. It's a topic of hot debate among Rails enthusiasts. I myself am quite impartial, having used both ERb and Haml in a production environment. Both are viable formats for your views, and there are pros and cons to both.

However, ERb is given preference here because the barrier to entry is lower and because I already picked HTTP for the "H" article.

####Syntax

ERb is one Rails solution for interpolating server-side code in HTML. This will be your main way of including dynamic data in your website.

The syntax is similar to other server-side web frameworks: <%= %> signifies that the enclosed code is Ruby and should be evaluated. For example, the following code:

{% highlight erb %}
    <p>This post has <%= @post.comments.size %> comments.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

...changes into this HTML when @post has 3 comments:

{% highlight html %}
    <p>This post has 3 comments.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

####Looping

ERb also allows for more complex types of interpolation with the <% %> syntax. For example:

{% highlight erb %}
    <% @post.comments.each do |comment| %>
      <p><%= comment.body %></p>
      <hr />
    <% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

...will change into something like this:

{% highlight html %}
      <p>First post!</p>
      <hr />
      <p>I like pancakes</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Blaaaah</p>
      <hr />
{% endhighlight %}

If you've ever worked with ASP.net or JSP, this is nothing new.

####Passing blocks

You can also pass blocks of HTML as if they are blocks of code:

{% highlight erb %}
    <%= form_for Comment.new do |f| %>
      <%= f.label :body %>:
      <%= f.text_area :body %>

      <%= f.submit %>
    <% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

...which renders a fully-functional HTML form.

####Server-side vs. client-side

The upside to ERb (and Haml) is that it's a fully server-side technology -- your users won't need to execute the code on their browsers or even know that it exists. You have full control over who has access to the code and over the environment in which the code is executed. That generally makes it much safer, faster, and easier to implement than a comparable solution in Flash or AJAX.

The downside is that you will be serving different data from the same URL, so it will be harder to take advantage of HTTP's built-in caching mechanisms. It also becomes more difficult to track exactly which content is being shown to which users. User experience is also affected as the user must reload the page to see changes in dynamic data. So, many Rails developers choose to display dynamic data with AJAX to address these problems.

In my opinion, the best way to deliver dynamic data will vary from project to project and even from page to page. So the responsibility must fall on the developer to take all these concerns into consideration and implement the best solution every time.
