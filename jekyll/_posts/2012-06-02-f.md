####Languages and paradigms

The Ruby language supports multiple _programming paradigms_, or programming styles, and functional programming is one of them. 

Like other paradigms (such as object-oriented programming), there are advanced users and there are beginners. But since this style of programming is so widely used in the Ruby community, it's important for anyone learning Rails to know the basics.

####Blocks

Here's some Ruby code that generates HTML for comments on a post:

{% highlight ruby %}
    @post.comments.each do |comment|
      result << "<p>" + comment.body + "</p>"
      result << "<hr />"
    end
{% endhighlight %}

...and stores it in the "result" variable.

The code above uses the Array#each method, which takes a _block_. A block is a chunk of Ruby code that appears between "do" and "end," or is surrounded by curly braces:

{% highlight ruby %}
    @post.comments.each { |comment|
      result << "<p>" + comment.body + "</p>"
      result << "<hr />"
    }
{% endhighlight %}

A block can itself take an argument, as in this example with the "comment" argument.

####More array methods

Array#each is only one of several core Ruby methods that take blocks. For example, say you want to filter all comments that contain certain keywords. You can do this using Array#select:

{% highlight ruby %}
    relevant_comments = @post.comments.select { |comment|
      comment.body.split.include?(keywords)
    }
{% endhighlight %}
    
And if you want to clean the comments from any HTML formatting, you might do so using Array#map:

{% highlight ruby %}
    plaintext_comments = @post.comments.map { |comment|
      sanitize(comment)
    }
{% endhighlight %}
    
####Chaining

It really gets interesting when you start chaining these methods together:

{% highlight ruby %}
    plaintext_relevant_comments = @post.comments.select { |comment|
      comment.body.split.include?(keywords)
    }.map { |comment|
      sanitize(comment)
    }
{% endhighlight %}

####Other languages

Functional programming can be used in other languages as well. For example, many of these methods are available in Javascript with Jeremy Ashkenas' __underscore.js__ (which in turn borrows from Oliver Steele's __Functional__):

{% highlight js %}
    _(post.comments).each(function(comment) {
      return "<p>" + comment.body + "</p><hr />";
    });
{% endhighlight %}
